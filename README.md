My experiment with Machine Learning and mental health diagnosis

So I was exploring (as one does) and I bumped into this idea of using biological data to predict mental health disorders. I thought this was really cool and so I got to work.
Three disorders, one healthy class and 83 columns of biological data. 
The dataset however is synthetic and very small in size with just 500 instances, so there were a few issues. I did this for a school project and for the sake of time, it was converted into a binary classification problem, healthy vs unhealthy.
But....
I still want to experiment with the multi-class problem. But I will upload my notebook on what has been done so far for now.
